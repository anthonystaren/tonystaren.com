I work at the intersection of deal-making, AI, and drug discovery.

By day, I advise on M&A transactions at B. Woods & Company, helping founders and business owners navigate complex deals. My background spans EY (advisory), Clarivate Analytics (life sciences data), and The Economist Intelligence Unit (global market analysis) — giving me a unique lens on valuation, strategy, and market opportunity.

By night, I'm deep in AI-driven pharmaceutical innovation. I hold two provisional patents on novel prodrug platforms that improve the bioavailability of natural therapeutic compounds — specifically L-Tetrahydropalmatine (L-THP) and Dehydrocorybulbine (DHCB). These compounds have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for over 1,000 years but suffer from poor oral absorption. My work uses AI to design hybrid molecules that solve this problem, offering non-addictive alternatives to opioids for pain and anxiety management.

Earlier in my career, I conducted clinical cancer research at Loyola University Medical Center and the Cancer Treatment Centers of America, presenting findings at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) 2010 Annual Meeting.

I also run Profacio, a wellness brand exploring novel natural product formulations, and StarenStudio, where I design and 3D-print creative products.

What I'm focused on now:
→ Closing M&A deals for mid-market companies
→ Advancing AI-designed prodrug compounds toward commercialization
→ Building tools that help professionals manage their online reputation (clearmyname.co)

Let's connect if you're working on anything at the intersection of AI, pharma, or deal strategy.
