# What I Learned About Business Development from Working at EY, The Economist, and Clarivate

Over the past decade, I've had the unusual experience of building business relationships across three very different organizations: a Big Four advisory firm, a global media intelligence company, and a life sciences data powerhouse. Each one taught me something fundamentally different about how deals actually get done.

Here are the five most important lessons I took away — and how they shaped the way I approach M&A advisory today.

## 1. At EY, I Learned That Trust Is the Product

When I joined EY's advisory practice, I assumed the work would sell itself. It doesn't. In professional services, your client is buying a relationship before they're buying a deliverable. The partners who consistently won engagements weren't necessarily the ones with the deepest technical expertise — they were the ones who had spent years building trust with decision-makers.

The lesson: Before you can advise someone on their most important business decisions, they need to believe you understand their world. That takes time, genuine curiosity, and showing up consistently — not just when there's a deal on the table.

This is something I carry into every M&A conversation today. Founders don't want to hear your pitch. They want to know you understand what they've built and why it matters to them.

## 2. At The Economist Intelligence Unit, I Learned to See the Macro Picture

Working at the EIU gave me a completely different vantage point. Instead of focusing on individual client relationships, I was looking at global market trends, country risk assessments, and cross-border business dynamics. The EIU's entire value proposition is helping executives make decisions based on data they can't get anywhere else.

What this taught me about business development: Context matters more than you think. When you're pitching a client, understanding the macroeconomic forces affecting their industry — regulatory changes, competitive dynamics, market timing — gives you credibility that no amount of relationship-building alone can match.

In M&A, this translates directly. Knowing why a sector is consolidating, which regulatory tailwinds are creating opportunities, or why a particular market is about to shift can be the difference between a relevant conversation and a wasted meeting.

## 3. At Clarivate, I Learned How Data Drives Decision-Making in Life Sciences

Clarivate Analytics sits at the intersection of intellectual property, scientific research, and life sciences data. Working there taught me how pharmaceutical and biotech companies actually make strategic decisions — and the answer is almost always data.

Patent landscapes, clinical trial databases, competitive intelligence on drug pipelines — these aren't just research tools. They're the foundation of billion-dollar licensing deals, M&A transactions, and portfolio strategies. I learned to see data not as a support function but as the core of strategic decision-making.

This is particularly relevant to my current work in AI drug discovery. Understanding how IP data flows through the pharmaceutical value chain helped me see opportunities where AI could genuinely accelerate innovation — not just in discovery, but in how compounds are evaluated, protected, and commercialized.

## 4. The Common Thread: Solving Problems People Didn't Know They Had

Across all three organizations, the most successful business developers I worked with shared one trait: they identified problems their clients hadn't fully articulated yet. At EY, it was showing a CFO a risk they hadn't considered. At the EIU, it was surfacing a market trend that contradicted conventional wisdom. At Clarivate, it was connecting IP data to a strategic question no one had thought to ask.

The best business development isn't about selling. It's about pattern recognition — seeing connections between information, people, and opportunities that others miss.

## 5. Why I Chose M&A Advisory

These experiences converged into a realization: I'm most energized when I'm helping someone navigate a high-stakes decision with incomplete information. That's exactly what M&A advisory is.

Every deal is a combination of financial analysis, market context, relationship dynamics, and strategic vision. The analytical frameworks I learned at the EIU, the relationship-building skills I developed at EY, and the data-driven decision-making I practiced at Clarivate all feed directly into how I advise clients at B. Woods & Company today.

If you're a founder or business owner thinking about your next chapter — whether that's an acquisition, a merger, or a strategic exit — I'd love to connect.
